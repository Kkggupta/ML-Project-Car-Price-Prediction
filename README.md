# ML-Project-Car-Price-Prediction 

This project aims to predict the selling price of a used car based on various features such as car brand, year sold, present price, and other relevant attributes. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and is preprocessed to handle missing values, scale numerical features, and prepare it for model training. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets to ensure a fair evaluation of the model's performance. Two machine learning algorithms, **Linear Regression** and **Lasso Regression**, are implemented to train the model and identify patterns in the data. Once trained, the model can predict the estimated price of a used car when provided with new input data. The accuracy of both models is compared to determine the most effective one for price prediction. This project demonstrates the application of regression techniques in machine learning and provides insights into how data-driven approaches can be used for price estimation in the automotive industry.
