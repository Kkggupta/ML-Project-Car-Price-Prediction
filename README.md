# ML-Project-Car-Price-Prediction
Overview
This project aims to predict the selling price of a used car based on various features such as brand, year sold, present price, etc. Using machine learning regression models, we analyze patterns in the dataset to provide accurate price predictions for new car data.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and includes the following features:

Car Brand
Year Sold
Present Price
Other relevant attributes
Workflow
Data Collection – Importing the dataset from Kaggle.
Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, feature selection, and scaling.
Train-Test Split – Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Training – Implementing and training Linear Regression and Lasso Regression models.
Model Evaluation – Comparing the accuracy of both models to determine the better-performing one.
Prediction – Using the trained model to predict the price of a used car based on new input data.
Algorithms Used
Linear Regression
Lasso Regression
Results
The models' accuracy is compared to determine the best fit for car price prediction.
